        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence,
            particularly in the fields
            of <strong><u>Quantum Machine Learning and Computer Vision</u></strong>. I am constantly seeking
            opportunities to
            learn and
            grow in these
            areas, and I am driven to develop innovative solutions using these technologies.
            <br><br>
            From 2021 to present, I have been very fortunate to be supervised by <strong>Professor Shexiang
                Jiang</strong> in
            research, competitions, and engineering projects. During my internship in the laboratory, I was also lucky
            to receive guidance from <strong>Preofessor Hongsheng Wang</strong> and <strong>Professor Shengyu
                Zhang</strong> .
            <br><br>
            Beyond academics, I prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This includes regular gym workouts and
            playing badminton. To balance this active side, I find solace in creative pursuits like cooking
            and calligraphy. These hobbies allow me to de-stress and explore various dimensions of myself.
