        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence,
            particularly in the fields
            of <strong><u>Quantum Machine Learning and Computer Vision</u></strong>. I am constantly seeking
            opportunities to
            learn and
            grow in these
            areas, and I am driven to develop innovative solutions using these technologies.
            <br><br>
            Since 2024, it has been an honor and a privilege to partner with <strong>Hongsheng Wang</strong>, our enthusiastic CEO, and <strong>Qiang Xiao</strong>, our innovative CTO, as co-founders of Lanxin Inc.. Together, we are dedicated to driving forward our vision and creating impactful solutions in our field.
            <br><br>
            From 2021 to present, I have been very fortunate to be supervised by <strong>Professor Shexiang
                Jiang</strong> in
            research and engineering projects. During my internship in the laboratory, I was also lucky
            to receive guidance from <strong>Professor Hongsheng Wang</strong> and <strong>Professor <a href="https://shengyuzhang.github.io">Shengyu
                Zhang</a></strong> .
            <br><br>
            Beyond academics, I prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This includes regular gym workouts and
            playing badminton. To balance this active side, I find solace in creative pursuits like cooking
            and calligraphy. These hobbies allow me to de-stress and explore various dimensions of myself.
